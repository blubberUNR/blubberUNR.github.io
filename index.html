<h2>Project 2:</h2>
<h2>CS 328 - Project 2: <b>Knock Them Down</b> (Angry Birds-like game)</h2>
<h3>How to play: </h3>
<h4><b>Controls:</b></h4>
<h5>  <i><b>Camera Controls:</b></i></h5>
<p>     The camera is centered on the starting position, and follows the player's ball after shooting. To see the rest of the map, you might need to use the manual camera.</p>
<p>     Press TAB to enter the manual camera. Press A or D to scroll left and right. Press TAB again to enter the stationary camera.</p>
<h5><i><b>Player Controls:</b></i></h5>
<p>     Click and drag to release. The farther you drag (up to a limit) the faster the ball is thrown.</p>
<h5><i><b>Levels and Rules:</b></i></h5>
<p>     Level one gives the player 3 lives (balls). Level two and three gives the player 5 lives due to increased difficulty.</p>
<p>     To <b>win</b>, eliminate all the enemy cats strewn across each level.</p>
<p>     Enemies are eliminated when collided with enough force, and can be eliminated from both the player and the environment (physical objects colliding due to physics).</p>
<p>     Map structure objects like walls and floors cannot be destroyed, though can be used to your advantage (slopes, physics, etc.)</p>
<p>     Players <b>lose</b> when they have used up all their lives and have not eliminated all the enemies.</p>
<p>         <b>NOTE: </b> At the top right there are two buttons, the left one restarts the level and the right one exits to the menu.</p>
<p>All assets besides the ingame music were created by me.</p>
